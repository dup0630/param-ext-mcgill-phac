**Value:** 10.8%

**Explanation:** The overall mortality rate reported in the study is 10.8%, which corresponds to the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) for measles among the 784 patients studied. This value is derived from the total number of deaths (85) divided by the total number of cases (784), yielding a CFR of 10.8%. The paper provides this figure in the context of discussing the mortality associated with measles complications, indicating that this rate reflects the severity of the disease in the studied population.

Additionally, the paper mentions that the CFR varies with specific complications, such as encephalitis (62.5%) and laryngotracheobronchitis (21.3%), but the overall CFR of 10.8% is the primary value requested.",10.84,Success,TP,8

**Value:** 1.1%

**Explanation:** The paper reports that out of 40 children admitted to the hospital due to complications from measles, 4 died, resulting in an overall mortality rate of 1.1%. This value is derived from the context of hospitalized patients with measles complications, making it relevant for the CFR calculation. The CFR is calculated as the number of deaths divided by the number of cases (deaths/cases), which in this case is 4 deaths out of 40 cases, yielding a CFR of 10%. However, the paper also states that the overall mortality associated with measles in the broader population of children under seven years in Nairobi is 24%, indicating that the CFR can vary based on the population subgroup being considered.

In summary, the CFR for hospitalized children with measles is 10%, while the overall mortality associated with measles in the population under seven years is reported as 24%. However, the specific CFR value requested is 1.1% based on the context of the hospitalized cases.",10.0,Fail,FN,8

2. **CFR for malnourished children (early consultation):** 14%
   - **Context:** The paper reports that the mortality rate for malnourished children who consulted early was 14%. This shows the benefit of early consultation in reducing mortality.

3. **CFR for well-nourished children (late consultation):** 10%

This value is derived from the total number of children affected by measles (1961 children) and the number of deaths (3).
