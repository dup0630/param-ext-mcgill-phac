**Value:** 10.8%

**Explanation:** The overall mortality rate reported in the study is 10.8%, which corresponds to the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) for measles among the 784 patients studied. This value is derived from the total number of deaths (85) divided by the total number of cases (784), yielding a CFR of 10.8%. The paper provides this figure in the context of discussing the mortality associated with measles complications, indicating that this rate reflects the severity of the disease in the studied population.

Additionally, the paper mentions that the CFR varies with specific complications, such as encephalitis (62.5%) and laryngotracheobronchitis (21.3%), but the overall CFR of 10.8% is the primary value requested.",10.84,Success,TP,8

**Value:** 1.1%

**Explanation:** The paper reports that out of 40 children admitted to the hospital due to complications from measles, 4 died, resulting in an overall mortality rate of 1.1%. This value is derived from the context of hospitalized patients with measles complications, making it relevant for the CFR calculation. The CFR is calculated as the number of deaths divided by the number of cases (deaths/cases), which in this case is 4 deaths out of 40 cases, yielding a CFR of 10%. However, the paper also states that the overall mortality associated with measles in the broader population of children under seven years in Nairobi is 24%, indicating that the CFR can vary based on the population subgroup being considered.

In summary, the CFR for hospitalized children with measles is 10%, while the overall mortality associated with measles in the population under seven years is reported as 24%. However, the specific CFR value requested is 1.1% based on the context of the hospitalized cases.",10.0,Fail,FN,8

During the measles epidemic in the study:

1. A total of **132 children** attended the feeding center.
2. **Two children** aged below six months died from complications (one from bronchopneumonia and one from dysentery). 

To calculate the CFR among the hospitalized cases (in this context, those who developed serious complications that may have led to hospitalization or death):

- **Numerator (Deaths)**: 2
- **Denominator (Hospitalized Cases)**: The number of children who were hospitalized or experienced severe complications. The text indicates that ""two required hospitalization for complications,"" making it unclear what the total number of cases that should be included in the denominator should be. However, we should assert that at least 2 children were hospitalized when the cases with complications were high.

Thus, if we assume the 2 children who died were the only cases that were hospitalized, the CFR could be simply computed as:
  
- CFR = (Number of Deaths / Number of Hospitalized Cases) * 100
- CFR = (2 / 2) * 100 = **100%**

This suggests that if only these two cases are considered from the available information, the CFR would reflect a very high rate. However, if there were more hospitalized cases not specified in the provided text, the CFR would need to be recalibrated based on the precise number of total hospitalized cases.

If we take into context the larger population that were affected and developed severe complications during the measles epidemic, the calculated CFR might show a different picture as the denominator would increase significantly. Unfortunately, based on the text given, a more precise and accurate calculation isn't possible without additional specific data on the total number of hospitalized cases.

### Explanation:
In the provided text, the research discusses cases of nosocomial measles and specifies that there was one death among the hospitalized cases. The total number of hospitalized cases related to nosocomial infection was reported as seven (8 patients in total with measles nosocomially, but only 1 was specified as a death and the count of hospitalized cases does not directly overlap with all reported cases of nosocomial measles). Therefore, the Hospitalized CFR is calculated using these specific values, giving an appropriate estimation of the fatality rate among hospitalized patients due to this outbreak of measles in healthcare settings.", 0,Fail,FN,13

- Total number of hospitalized cases: Not explicitly stated, but can be approximated. The note mentions 604 reported measles cases, but it does not provide a clear indication of the number that were hospitalized. Further context was not available to determine how many of these cases were hospitalized specifically.

#### Computation or Inference:
- The CFR is typically calculated by the formula:
  
  \[
  CFR = \left( \frac{\text{Number of deaths among hospitalized cases}}{\text{Total number of hospitalized cases}} \right) \times 100

The values were found in the results section of the text, where it explicitly states that ""1,279 (24%) ont été hospitalisés"" (1,279 were hospitalized) and that ""Quatre cas sont décédés"" (four cases died). The CFR is calculated using the formula for hospital settings, which is the number of deaths among hospitalized patients divided by the total number of hospitalized cases, multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage. Here, the CFR calculation was derived from the specified numbers directly reported in the study, ensuring accuracy.

#### Values Found:
1. **Total number of deaths among hospitalized cases:** 2
2. **Total number of hospitalized cases:** Not explicitly provided, however, there is a reference to ""les cas notifiés"" (notified cases) which totals **604.** 

#### Calculation:
To compute the Hospitalized Case Fatality Rate (CFR), the following formula is used:
\[
\text{CFR} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of deaths among hospitalized cases}}{\text{Total number of hospitalized cases}} \right) \times 100
\]

However, since we do not have the exact number of hospitalized cases, assuming that the death cases are among those reported, we can calculate an approximate CFR from the notified cases, albeit this method does have limitations as it assumes all notified cases were hospitalized cases:

\[
\text{CFR} ≈ \left( \frac{2}{604} \right) \times 100 ≈ 0.33\%
\]

### Context of Value:
- The two deaths reported occurred due to complications from measles: one from acute encephalitis and the other from pneumonia due to pre-existing conditions.
- The CFR here is inferred from the total reported cases (604) and does not specifically segregate those who were hospitalized vs. those who were not, highlighting a lack of detailed subgroup analysis in the paper.

#### Limitations:
1. **Assumption on Hospitalization:** This calculation assumes that the deaths are among the noted cases without confirming which of those were specifically hospitalized, potentially leading to an underestimation of CFR if the actual hospitalizations were lower than the total reported cases.
2. **No clear breakdown of hospitalized vs. non-hospitalized cases** in the text makes it challenging to derive an accurate CFR specifically for hospitalized individuals only. 

### Conclusion:
The Hospitalized Case Fatality Rate (CFR) for the measles outbreak in France in 2008, inferred from the available data, is approximately **0.33%.** It is important to note the limitations of this inference due to the lack of precise hospitalization data in the provided text.", 3.23,Fail,FN,13

#### Explanation:
The Hospitalized Case Fatality Rate (CFR) was explicitly mentioned in the results section of the paper, where it states: ""A total of 293 patients improved and were sent home, while thirty eight patients (11.48%) died on the ward."" To derive this number for the CFR calculation, we can identify the following values:

- **Denominator (Total hospitalized cases):** 331 patients

Now, the CFR can be computed as follows:

This percentage exactly matches the reported mortality rate for the cohort studied (hospitalized measles patients), affirming that the 11.48% is indeed the appropriate and accurate value for the Hospitalized CFR in this context. 

Additionally, the paper mentions nuances in mortality associated with different age groups. For instance, the mortality was higher in younger patients, with specific percentages noted for groups 1 and 2 (10.44% and 16.12% respectively).

**Value Extracted:** 12.9%

**Source and Context:**
The Hospitalized Case Fatality Rate (CFR) for measles in the studied population is reported explicitly in the results section of the paper, where it states, ""Case fatality rate is 12.9%."" The CFR is calculated in this context as the percentage of deaths among hospitalized patients who had measles. While the paper does not provide the exact number of deaths or hospitalized cases leading to this CFR in the quoted statement, it can be inferred from the context that the study closely examined patients admitted with measles.

Given that the total number of patients who were admitted with measles during the study is 62, this CFR suggests that a portion of these cases resulted in mortality, although the paper explicitly mentions that out of 8 children who died from measles complications, most had bronchopneumonia (the prevalent cause of death). 

To confirm the CFR calculation:
- **Total hospitalized cases (measles): 62**
- **Total deaths among these cases: 8 (as inferred from the table regarding causes of death)**

Calculating the CFR: 
\[
CFR = \left( \frac{\text{Number of deaths}}{\text{Total hospitalized cases}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{8}{62} \right) \times 100 \approx 12.9\%
