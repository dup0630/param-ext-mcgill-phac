### Extraction Scripts `pipelines/getRawExtraction.py`

Performs extraction on papers that include the `true` parameter.

- **Input**: 
  - Processed research papers (text and CSV formats).
- **Output**: Excel file with two sheets:
  - **Sheet 1**: 
    - `paperID`
    - Ground-truth hospitalized CFR (`true`)
    - Raw GPT response
    - Extracted hospitalized CFR
  - **Sheet 2**:
    - Standardized extraction format
    - Important keywords
    - Calculated CFR (`Numerator / Denominator`)

### Extraction Scripts `pipelines/extractForAll.py`

Full-batch extraction from all processed documents.

- **Input**: 
  - All processed research papers.
- **Output**: Same format as `getRawExtraction.py`, but for the complete dataset.

---

### Output Files `results/sampledstdFormatCFR.xlsx`

- **Source**: Output of `getRawExtraction.py`.
- **Usage**: 
  - Suitable for evaluation and quality measurement.
  - Can be used to derive extraction accuracy.

### Output Files `results/ALLstdFormatCFR.xlsx`

- **Source**: Output of `extractForAll.py`.
- **Content**:
  - **Sheet 1**:
    - Raw GPT responses
    - Extracted hospitalized CFR values
    - Useful for epidemiologists during manual inspection.
  - **Sheet 2**:
    - List of extracted keywords
    - May be useful for reference, but not reliable as Sheet 1.
